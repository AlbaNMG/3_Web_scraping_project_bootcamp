## Project Description

In this project, you will choose a topic and find all the relevant data yourself from Kaggle.
Afterwards, you should enrich it by connecting to an API, find a dataset or scrape data from the web.
You then must organize, clean and analyse the data you find and present your findings in a presentation (you may use plots!).
